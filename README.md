### Hello! My name is Muhammad Kamran, I'm a Full Stack Developer out of the Bay Area.


## 🔭 I’m currently working on a lazy Git CLI, to create and update repos from my laptops and possibly update them on a schedule (when I forget, I use multiple PCs).
## 🌱 I’m currently learning to animate better with CSS.
## 📫 How to reach me: me@mkamran.us
## ⚡ Fun fact: I like motorcycles 🏍
